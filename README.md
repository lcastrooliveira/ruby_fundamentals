# ruby_fundamentals
Just a bunch of files I've made in the process while becoming a ruby ninja.
I've done this excellent course at Udemy.com called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/comprehensive-ruby-programming-tutorial/"> Comprehensive ruby programming</a>. 99% of the solutions for the problems shown are credited to the
course's author <a href="http://portfolio.jordanhudgens.com/">Jordan Hudgens</a>. If you want to start learning ruby seriously I strongly recommend taking his course.
